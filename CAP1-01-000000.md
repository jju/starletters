Greetings CAP2. You should probably know that I sent in a formal request for reconsideration on this mission. You would have been the much better choice for leading our mission. It looks like you have the right sort of crew, if the reports are accurate (and why wouldn’t they be, right?) and the future would just be better in your hands.

I mean, this is the issue. I think this mission is too big.

I know that I’m supposed to be projecting confidence, and I swear to any of the surveillors that I’m putting that face on for my crew, but really. This is not going to go well for us here.

We have a shipload of colonists who all expect wonderful things when we get out to SYSTEM1, and they don’t fucking know that every ship that has gone there already has been obliterated.

Hm. I guess that makes me saying you should be on this mission sound a little less flattering. That wasn’t my intention. I’m saying that you’re the one who could have pulled some adventure hero from the swashy dramas excrement that would make this work. Not me.

Apparently the idea is that since the last three ships that went to SYSTEM1 were military ships with escalated up weapons, and each of them was vaporized what they need is to send something peaceful and reassuring. Because sending a bunch of meatsacks that are immensely disciplined at all times will be so reassuring.

I’m sure there’s more to this, but whatever. I’m just the captain. You would have winkled the real mission out from the adminbots already. That’s not why they’re sending me though. I’m not sure what the real reason might be but it’s not to be creative, to pull some brilliant save out. I think the Supreme is just getting this old ship out of the system so it doesn’t need to suffer the ignominy of being recycled.

In any case, I hope your delivery goes well. I hope it’s less pointless than it seems to be sending all those acolytes on a messenger run. When we get back we should listen to one of those operas you like. They have those with synchronicity, right?
