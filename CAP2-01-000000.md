CAP1 I can see your ship from here! How did you manage to get such a big one? I guess it's too late for me to barge in and trade.  

You'd like the SHIP2. It's quiet and everyone is very serious. You would think this was a mission to prove our worth to all Divinity or something. The priests have gathered down below and they're singing about the bounty of the meals and then I think that means the food supply is good to go for the voyage. XO2 really doesn't like the songs, but she was a better student of all the ritual than me. Not as good as you, I'm sure.

Remember that park under the cliffs in CITY0? I thought it was so pretty and you told me how it had been built on a toxic waste pile. But it was "probably" pretty deep. Well, we're heading out with a bunch of that stuff in our hold. Apparently they need this specific combination of bits and bobs out on DESTINATION2. But you probably already know that. How well have you analyzed our itinerary? See any room for improvement? Ha!

Does it seem weird to you how these assignments were made? The Authority never does things the way I would, but it does seem weird to send all these monks (priests? Nuns? I really don’t know but COUNSELLOR2 is pretty on top of all those sects. I’ll ask him later.) To deliver a bunch of goop to a medical station. Why does the goop need all this religion? Or is it the doctors that need the priests? Maybe this is all just a cover for a full-blown crisis of faith. I feel like I read a story about that once. Probably a few times when we were supposed to be studying.

But it’ll be fine. I wanted to send you a little message before we take off. I know it’ll be a while. You stay safe doing whatever you’re doing in that gargantua. It’s probably tempting fate to say what we should do when we get back right? Just asking for trouble? But you don’t care about superstition, and I’m going to have my fill of it once I’m done with all these pastors, so I’ll buck the trend and say we should see who’s the better hand at darts next time we hang out. Look at that, I’m giving you fair warning so you can spend your time practicing. Good luck sweetheart.
